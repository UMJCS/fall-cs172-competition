## cloud point competition

First my video is too large so that I CAN NOT upload 100M file use git.

So if you want to watch the video ---> first run /src/video/img2video.py then run it after frames already created.

So if you want to recreate my result ---> run /src/video/main.py  and run /src/photos/main.py

Then create the video ---> run /src/video/img2video.py
